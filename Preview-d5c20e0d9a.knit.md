Introduction
===
This report uses the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the participants did the exercise. We were to create a report describing 1) how we built the model, 2) how we used cross validation, 3)what we think the expected out of sample error is, and 4) why we made the choices we did.

Getting the Data
===
To start, I downloaded the data and read the data into R.
